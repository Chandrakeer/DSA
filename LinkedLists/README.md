# Linked Lists

## Overview

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence.

## Key Concepts

- **Dynamic Size**: Can grow or shrink during execution
- **Sequential Access**: Must traverse from head to reach an element
- **Non-contiguous Memory**: Nodes can be stored anywhere in memory
- **Types**: Singly, Doubly, and Circular linked lists

## Common Operations

| Operation | Time Complexity |
|-----------|----------------|
| Access    | O(n)           |
| Search    | O(n)           |
| Insertion (at head) | O(1) |
| Deletion (at head)  | O(1) |

## Important Techniques

1. **Two Pointers (Fast & Slow)**: Detect cycles, find middle
2. **Dummy Node**: Simplify edge cases
3. **Recursion**: For reversal and traversal
4. **In-place Modification**: Reverse or rearrange without extra space

## Common Problem Patterns

- Reversing linked lists
- Detecting and removing cycles
- Merging linked lists
- Finding middle element
- Removing nth node

## Practice Problems

### Easy
- [ ] Reverse Linked List
- [ ] Merge Two Sorted Lists
- [ ] Linked List Cycle
- [ ] Remove Duplicates from Sorted List

### Medium
- [ ] Add Two Numbers
- [ ] Remove Nth Node From End
- [ ] Reorder List
- [ ] Linked List Cycle II

### Hard
- [ ] Merge k Sorted Lists
- [ ] Reverse Nodes in k-Group
- [ ] Copy List with Random Pointer
