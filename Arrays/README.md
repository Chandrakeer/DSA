# Arrays

## Overview

Arrays are a fundamental data structure that stores elements in contiguous memory locations. They allow random access to elements using indices.

## Key Concepts

- **Fixed Size**: Arrays have a fixed size determined at creation
- **Index-based Access**: O(1) time complexity for accessing elements
- **Contiguous Memory**: Elements stored in consecutive memory locations
- **Same Data Type**: All elements must be of the same type

## Common Operations

| Operation | Time Complexity |
|-----------|----------------|
| Access    | O(1)           |
| Search    | O(n)           |
| Insertion | O(n)           |
| Deletion  | O(n)           |

## Important Techniques

1. **Two Pointers**: Use two pointers to traverse the array
2. **Sliding Window**: Maintain a window of elements
3. **Kadane's Algorithm**: Maximum subarray sum
4. **Prefix Sum**: Precompute cumulative sums
5. **Binary Search**: Search in sorted arrays

## Common Problem Patterns

- Finding duplicates
- Rotating arrays
- Merging sorted arrays
- Subarray problems
- Matrix traversal
